nuget-inspector - inspect nuget and .NET projects packages dependencies
========================================================================

Homepage: https://github.com/aboutcode-org/nuget-inspector and https://www.aboutcode.org/


``nuget-inspector`` is a utility to:

- resolve .NET project nuget packages dependencies

- parse various project and package manifests and lockfiles such as .csproj files,
  and several related formats (including legacy formats)

- query NuGet.org APIs for package information to support dependency resolution

It grew out of the need to have a reliable way to analyze .NET code projects and
their dependencies independently of the availability of a dotnet SDK installed
on the machine that runs this analysis; and that could run on Linux, Windows and
macOS.

The goal of nuget-inspector is to be a comprehensive tool that can handle every
style of .NET and NuGet projects and package layouts, manifests and lockfiles.


    WARNING! this tool is under heavy development and its CLI options and output
    format are evolving quickly.


Usage
--------

- Install the dotnet SDK 6.x for your platform from Microsoft
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/

- Download and extract the pre-built binary release archive from the release page
  https://github.com/aboutcode-org/nuget-inspector for your operating system. (Linux-only
  for now)

- Run the command line utility with::

    nuget-inspector --help

For instance, you can fetch nuget-inspector own project file at::

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexB/nuget-inspector/main/src/nuget-inspector/nuget-inspector.csproj

And then run::

    nuget-inspector --project-file nuget-inspector.csproj --json nuget-inspector.json

And review the ``nuget-inspector.json`` JSON output file with its resolved dependencies.
Note that the output data structure is evolving and not final.

These projects are used either in the built executables, at build time or for
testing (a large number are used for testing). The built executables are designed
to be self-contained exes that do not require additional libraries to run on the
target system, beyond a dotnet SDK.
